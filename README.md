# Despatch Handling (APP)

Despatch Handling (APP) is a simulated environment available on GitHub at [Despatch Sig](https://github.com/zahidhasann88/despatch-sig), replicating the process of dispatch handling and registration within a signal center.

## Overview

The Simulation of Despatch Handling in Signal Centre aims to mirror the dispatch handling and registration process within a signal center environment.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a simulated environment for understanding and practicing dispatch handling processes within a signal center.

## Features

- **Simulation Environment**: Provides a realistic simulation of dispatch handling and registration.
- **Data Privacy Consideration**: Focuses on maintaining security and data privacy, especially concerning sensitive dispatch information.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Flask**: Micro web framework used for backend development.
- **JavaScript**: Used for frontend functionalities.
- **Bootstrap**: Frontend framework for responsive and mobile-first web development.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing and managing simulation data.

## Challenges Faced

Maintaining security and ensuring data privacy in a simulated environment, especially when dealing with sensitive dispatch information, presented significant challenges during the development of this project.
